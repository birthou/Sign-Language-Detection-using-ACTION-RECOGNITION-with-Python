# Sign-Language-Detection-using-ACTION-RECOGNITION-with-Python
You'll be able to leverage a keypoint detection model to build a sequence of keypoints which can then be passed to an action detection model to decode sign language! As part of the model building process you'll be able to leverage Tensorflow and Keras to build a deep neural network that leverages LSTM layers to handle the sequence of keypoints.
